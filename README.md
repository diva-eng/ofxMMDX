###Introduction
MMD is popular among VOCALOID [link] lovers, its big community had made a vast varity of model and animations avaliable. The problem is, there is still not enough libraries for building applications off. This is made using the latest lpvp library to make sure latest support of models and motion files. Since these files are written in C++, it is safe to assume making this project avaliable in other platform is easy.
